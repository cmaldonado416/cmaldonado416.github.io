  <h1>My Story</h1>

  <img src="DR.2012.000.jpg">

   <p>I began traveling when I was very young, and not necessarily by choice. Both of my parents immigrated from the Dominican Republic to the U.S. to create a better life, but their heart was definitely back in the island. Every summer, they would gather savings to take us all back to abuelita's house.</p>

  <p>Weaving in and out of the U.S. and growing up in Dominican culture has allowed me a unique insight into traveling. I gained a different perspective of what life is like outside of the U.S. at a very young age and as I grew older I became passionate around exploring Latin American culture. I like to explore the cultural similarities and differences, but most of all I enjoy establishing friendships and creating lasting memories. </p>

  <p>This blog a collection of those lived experiences and learned lessons, hope you enjoy!</p>
